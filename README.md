# Refugia-and-turbidity
R script and figures for the Climate‐change refugia: shading reef corals by turbidity: 10.1111/gcb.13166

We hypothesized that some turbid nearshore environments may act as climate‐change refuges, 
shading corals from the harmful interaction between high sea‐surface temperatures and high irradiance. 
We took a hierarchical Bayesian approach to determine the expected distribution of 12 coral species 
in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, between the latitudes 37°N and 37°S, 
under representative concentration pathway 8.5 (W m−2) by 2100.
